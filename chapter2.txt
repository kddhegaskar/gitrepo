chapter2:
That dual identity would  provide an ongoing sense of tension for the saga. Upon reaching adulthood, 
the milld-mannered Clark Kent moves from Smallville to urban Metropolis, where he works as a reporter for the Daily Planet. There he develops a romantic interest in fellow reporter Lois Lane (a character modeled in part on Siegel’s future wife, Joanne). She, however, dazzled by the courageous crime-fighting exploits of Superman and unaware of his dual identity, continually rejects Kent’s overtures. The audience, privy to the secret that continually eluded Lois, identified with Clark as a downtrodden “everyman
,” while Superman served as a beacon of hope during the depths of the Great Depression.
