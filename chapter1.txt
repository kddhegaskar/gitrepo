Superman’s origin is perhaps one of the best-known stories in comic book history. Indeed, in All Star Superman no. 1 (2005),
 writer Grant Morrison and artist Frank Quitely expertly cover the salient points with just four panels and eight words. On the doomed planet Krypton, scientists Jor-El and Lara place their infant son Kal-El into a rocket bound for Earth. He is found by Martha and Jonathan Kent, a kindly couple from the mid-American town of Smallville. They name the boy Clark and raise him as their own. As a child, Clark exhibits a collection of superhuman powers—invulnerability, incredible strength, the ability to leap incredible distances, 
and super speed—that would later become the hallmarks of his alter ego, Superman, the “Man of Steel.”
